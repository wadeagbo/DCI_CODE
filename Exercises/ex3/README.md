# Python Introduction

## Basic control flow

In this exercise, we will focus on the usage of the basic control flow operations, including:  
 - if-else statements,
 - for and while loops, 
 - input from the user,
 - comparison operators,
 - assignment operators,
 - logical operators.

## Tasks

### 

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 1 - basic math operations

Your task is to write a program which asks the user three times for a number. If number is even print ‘Even number’, else print ‘Odd number’.

>Hint: you can use `for` or `while` loop to perform the same operation more than once!

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter number: 123
Odd number
Enter number: 32
Even number
Enter number: 121234
Even number
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 2 - printing numbers with `range()` function

Your task is to write a program which asks the user about number of arguments in `range()` function.  
If number is 1 program asks for another number and then prints digits from `range()` function with given number.  
If number is 2 program asks for two numbers and then prints digits from `range()` function with given range.  
If number is 3 program asks for three numbers and then prints digits from `range()` function with given range and given step.  

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter number of arguments in range() function: 3
Enter starting number: 2
Enter stopping number: 8
Enter step: 2
2
4
6
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 3 - finding divisors of a number

Your task is to write a program which prints all the divisors of a number. 
The number comes from the user's input.

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter number: 56
2
4
7
8
14
28
56
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 4 - check prime number

Your task is to write a program to check if input number is a prime number.  
>Hint: Prime number divides without rest only by 1 and itself!

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter number: 63
63  is not a prime number
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 5 - FizzBuzz

Your task is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.  
 But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.   
 For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 6 - divisible numbers

Your task is to write a program to print all the numbers between 1000 and 2000 which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5.

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
1001
1008
1022
1029
1036
1043
1057
1064
1071
...
...
1974
1981
1988
```
