# Python Introduction

## Comparison and logical operators

In this exercise, we will focus on the usage of the comparison and logical operators, including:  
 - equal operator `==`,
 - not equal operator `!=`,
 - greater than operator `>`,
 - less than operator `<`,
 - greater than or equal to operator `>=`,
 - less than or equal to operator `<=`,
 - `and`, `or`, `not` logical operators, 
 - using `None`.

## Tasks

### 

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 1 - comparison operators

Your task is to write a program which asks the user three times about two integer numbers to compare. 
>Hint: Use `while` loop to perform the same operation more than once!  

Use both comparison and logical operators, for example use logical comparison between two or more comparion operators:  
>Example: 
```python
result = None
if (expression1) and (expression2):
    print(information)
```
Create **at least ten** comparisons!  

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
Enter first number: 1234
Enter second number: 5432
Numbers are not equal
Second number is greater than first number
Second number is greater than or equal to first number
Both numbers are big!
big_numbers is set to  True

Enter first number: 23
Enter second number: 4567
Numbers are not equal
Second number is greater than first number
Second number is greater than or equal to first number
Both numbers are not big!
big_numbers is set to  False
```

### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 2 - convertion month name to a number of days

Your task is to write a Python program to convert month name to a number of days. 
>Hint: Print list of months at the beginning.  

User should be prompted to enter name of the month and the output shoul be the number of days in given month.

- Some of your results could look like this:

```bash
List of months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December
Input the name of Month: May
Number of days: 31 days
```
