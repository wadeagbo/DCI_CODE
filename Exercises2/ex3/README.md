# The Secret of Love :
#### Everyone wants to hide their secrets, especially if those are their love's secrets
:bulb: **To help them we will write a cipher for their secrets.**

There will be inputs : :secret: the secret  , :gift_heart: love name,  :birthday: year of birth.

> **Secret condition** :point_up: : The secret must be at least **8** **characters**.

### The cipher algorithm is :
* Concatenate the love secret with the love name     :arrow_heading_down:
* Reverse the string :arrow_heading_down:
* Concatenate the revered string with the  year of birth :arrow_heading_down:

>  ***NOTE:*** We need to cipher the secret itself , not to create a new  ciphered string.

### Input
```
*secret:* this_is_my_secret  
*name:* Max  
*year:* 1982  
```

### Output
```
xaMterces_ym_si_siht1982
```
