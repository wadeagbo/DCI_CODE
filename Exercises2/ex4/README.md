# length() in Python
## Overview:
The len() method is used to get the length of a string. The length is equal to the number of Unicode code units in a string.

## Task
Write a program that detects if a string has an even/odd number of characters and prints "even" or "odd" accordingly.


## Input --> Output
```
"hello world"     -->    "odd"  
"hello planet"    -->    "even"  
""                -->    "even"  
```
