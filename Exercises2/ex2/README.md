# String Basics 2

## Python Methods

In this exercise, we will focus on the use and manipulation of text in Python, including :

* Counting characters in the text
* Slicing strings

## Tasks

### Task 1

Create a variable called ```text``` to store the data: ```Berlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science.``` . Your task is to print the length of the ```text``` variable on the screen. 

* Your result should look like this:

```bash
63
```

### Task 2

Reuse the variable called ```text```  and print the first and the last characters on the screen. 

* Your result should look like this:

```bash
B .
```

### Task 3

Reuse the variable called ```text```  and print the first three characters in upper case.

* Your result should look like this:

```bash
First three characters: BER
```

### Task 4

Create the variable called ```text``` with the following content:  ```Berlin is surrounded by the State of Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital ```, then count how many times the letter  ```B ``` appears in the text.

* Your result should look like this:

```bash
B appears:  3  times
```

### Task 5

Create a variable called ```text``` to store the data: ```Berlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau.``` . Your task is to print the last 10 characters of the ```text``` variable on screen.

* Your result should look like this:

```bash
Last ten characters: f Spandau.
```

### Task 6

Create a variable called ```text``` to store the data: ```---Python programming---``` . Your task is to remove the hyphen (```-```) character from the string.

* Your result should look like this:

```bash
Python programming
```

### Task 7

Create two variables to store your first and your last name. Your task is to concatenate the two variables using the appropriate labels.

* You should provide a single line print statement.

* Your result should look like this:

```bash
Firstname: Mary 
Lastname: Mat
```
