# Datetime Basics 1

## Python datetime module

In this exercise, we will focus on creating datetime objects in Python, including printing special string formating of time.

- create a variable that stores the current time
- print out current year
- Print the weekday of the week
- Write a program to determine if a provided date is a leap year
- Convert a string into a datetime object

##

## Usage

A datetime module can be used to represent a time, we shall use the `.now()` method to get the current year.

```
from datetime import datetime
current_datetime = datetime.now()
```

To see what you can possibly do with the instance of datetime, experiment with the existing methods.

```
dir(current_datetime)
```

##

## Tasks

###

### Task 1

Using the variable called `current_datetime`, print out the current year

- Your result should look like this (assuming today is Wednesday, the value will be 2) :

```
2
```

###

### Task 2

Using the variable called `some_date`, print out the current week day

`some_date = datetime(2021, 7, 14)`

- Your result should look like this - (a number between 0 and 6)

```
2
```

###

### Task 3

Write a Python program to determine whether the year 2021 is a leap year.

- Your result should look like this:

```
2021 is a leap year
```

###

### Task 4

Your task is to convert a user provided string into a datetime object.

Our test input looks like this:

```
from datetime import datetime
date_as_string = "Feb 14 2021 8:30AM"
```

- Your result should look like this:

```
2021-02-14 08:30:00
```
