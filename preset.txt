An on-premises data center is a group of servers that you privately own and control. 

"On-prem" refers to private data centers that companies house in their own facilities and maintain themselves. On-prem infrastructure can be used to run private clouds, in which compute resources are virtualized in much the same way as those of public clouds (however, private clouds can also be run on leased third-party hardware).



----------------
Traditional cloud computing (as opposed to hybrid or private cloud computing models) involves leasing 
data center resources from a third-party service provider.


When people speak of cloud computing, they’re most often referring to "traditional," or "public," cloud, a model in which a third-party service provider makes computing resources available for consumption on an as-needed basis. Public cloud is a multi-tenant environment, meaning that these computing resources are shared by multiple individuals or companies, with all data secured by state-of-the-art encryption.
