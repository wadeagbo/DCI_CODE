VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT EXERCISE
############################



Using the skills you have already + the knowledge available online,
you are now to program a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface).


A GUI is an interface that allows users to interacte with an electronical device or a program.
Although being the job of mainly frontend developers, in backend also here is use of
a GUI sometimes. As I showed you in 14 and 41 or even in the Lazy Script.
The story program also had a form of GUI as you saw (graphical) what are the options, and
could interact with the menu by giving input (as the user).


FOR THIS YOU WILL NEED

SOME SORT OF LIBRARY (so the venv makes sense)
print() # to print a gui
input() # to ask for user input
if else # to use the user input for navigation through the menu
CREATING A requirements.txt LISTING THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS


FOR THIS YOU CAN USE

loops   # to let a user stay in a specific menu until he wants to leave


There is example code in this folder.


REMEMBER: This is a VENV exercise. So creating a virtual environment before starting to code
is essential.
